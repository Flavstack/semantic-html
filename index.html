            <p>
                Soon to be a well taught software developer. Learning html, css, and Javascript currently. Had one year of credit of business finance but decided that was not what I truly wanted to do. Software development is truly my interest. I took a HTMl class in 7th grade and a robotics call in 8th grade.

            <p>
                As I grew up as a gamer, objectives and problem-solving has been something I get a thrill of accomplishing. Software development is not easy and that is what attracts me to it. The epiphany that comes to you once you fix your code after it was not working. I always saw myself either creating an app that helps people or a video game that one day can be something many can enjoy.
